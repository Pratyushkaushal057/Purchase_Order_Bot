# Purchase_Order_Bot
The Purchase Order Bot is an unattended automation designed to streamline the creation of purchase orders in the Apptivo Purchase Order Management system. The process begins with a Dispatcher bot, which reads transaction data from the Data\PurchaseOrders.xlsx file. This file contains essential details such as the supplier, address, city, state, zip code, and item name, all of which are used to create transactions in the UiPath Orchestrator Queue. Once the Dispatcher successfully completes its run, the user proceeds to execute the Main.xaml file, which is structured with UiPath's ReFramework for enhanced reliability. This bot, known as the Performer, retrieves the transactions from the queue and automatically creates the corresponding purchase orders in the Apptivo system. After each purchase order is generated, the bot updates the respective purchase order number back into the Data\PurchaseOrders.xlsx file, ensuring accurate record-keeping and reducing manual effort. This bot enhances efficiency by automating the entire purchase order creation process, from data entry to final documentation.
